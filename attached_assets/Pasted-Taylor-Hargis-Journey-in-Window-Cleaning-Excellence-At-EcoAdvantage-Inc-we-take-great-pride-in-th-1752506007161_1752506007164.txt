Q&A With Taylor Hargis
Window Cleaning Specialist | EcoAdvantage Inc.

What inspired you to follow in your family’s footsteps and pursue a career in window cleaning?
“I didn’t think much about it until I worked with my dad for a week. I discovered I had a talent for it, but more importantly, I loved the work. For the first time in my life, I genuinely felt excited to go to work. On my very proud family lineage in window cleaning, I felt like this is where I belonged.”

Taylor’s discovery wasn’t just about finding a job — it was about recognizing a calling. What began as a week of work turned into a mission of upholding and evolving her family’s legacy with passion and pride.

What was it like learning the trade and working alongside your family?
“Rewarding” is the word Taylor uses most often.

“We became closer by working together and I felt like the family business and legacy gave me purpose. My wish is that my grandpa could have seen me as a window cleaner before he passed away.”

At EcoAdvantage, legacy isn’t just heritage — it’s purpose. Taylor brings that mindset to every job site, blending old-school dedication with new-school professionalism.

What challenges have you faced as a woman in the window cleaning industry, and how have you overcome them?
“Early on, I felt like I had to prove myself more, but I’ve always believed that skill and excellence speak louder than anything.”

“Some customers didn’t take me seriously at first. It took some time for people to trust I knew what I was doing. My confidence grew, so did my relationships with customers.”

Her response captures what many in skilled trades face: earning trust through consistency, care, and unmatched attention to detail.

What’s one piece of advice you’d give to the next generation of window cleaners?
“Anyone new I highly recommend working alongside a veteran for at least a year! Don’t be afraid to ask questions and learn from the people around you. This is a hands-on trade, and there’s so much you can learn just by watching and listening.”

Taylor’s advice echoes a key EcoAdvantage belief — excellence is taught, not inherited. Growth comes from humility, discipline, and hands-on experience.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Window Cleaning
When asked about the future of the industry, Taylor sees both challenge and opportunity:

“I can see window cleaning evolving to include more solar cleaning very quickly. While it is a separate industry, the crossover from window cleaning to solar cleaning is a pretty natural transition.”

“As for my future, I want to continue growing within the company and hopefully pass this knowledge on to the next generation — just like my dad and grandpa did for me.”

At EcoAdvantage, we’re not just preparing for change — we’re helping shape it. Taylor’s vision reflects where the trade is headed: toward tech-driven solutions, industry crossovers, and continued professionalization.
