Website Improvements for Eco Advantage Inc
SEO & Regional Targeting Improvements
Incorporate Local Keywords: Update site content to include region-specific keywords for Southwest Michigan and Northwest Indiana, often referred to as the Michiana area
ecoadvantageinc.com
ecoadvantageinc.com
. Mention nearby cities and service areas (e.g. Edwardsburg, Niles, Buchanan, and Cassopolis in Michigan; South Bend, Mishawaka, Elkhart, and Granger in Indiana). This will improve local search visibility.
Optimize Meta Tags: Ensure each page has a unique, descriptive meta title and meta description that include the services and regions. For example: “Window Cleaning in Southwest Michigan & Northern Indiana – Eco Advantage Inc”. Include relevant keywords like “power washing Michiana”, “healthcare facility cleaning Michigan Indiana”, etc., in a natural way for better SEO.
Use Alt Text with Keywords: Add descriptive alt text to all images, incorporating keywords and locations. For instance, an image of window cleaning might have alt text like: "Technicians performing window cleaning in South Bend, Indiana" – this helps SEO and accessibility.
Structured Data: (Optional) Implement Local Business schema (JSON-LD) with the company’s name, address (Edwardsburg, MI), phone numbers, and service area. This can improve how search engines display the business info.
New Service-Specific Pages & Site Structure
Create Dedicated Pages: Add separate landing pages for each core service offering to target specific keywords and improve user navigation. Based on the business, create pages for:
Window Cleaning – Emphasize commercial & residential window washing expertise
ecoadvantageinc.com
, using eco-friendly practices. Include keywords like “professional window cleaning in Michigan and Indiana”.
Power Washing – Detail exterior home/building cleaning services
ecoadvantageinc.com
, such as siding, driveways, etc., highlighting safe and effective power washing techniques for the region’s climate.
Healthcare Cleaning – Focus on hospital and healthcare facility cleaning (critical-area medical cleaning)
ecoadvantageinc.com
. Mention compliance with health standards, specialized training, and experience cleaning clinics/hospitals in Michiana.
Carpet & Floor Care – Describe services like IICRC-certified carpet cleaning and floor restoration
ecoadvantageinc.com
ecoadvantageinc.com
. Mention tile and grout cleaning, floor polishing, etc., and the use of eco-friendly products.
Consulting/Training – Outline the consulting and training services the company provides
ecoadvantageinc.com
. For example, advising businesses on their cleaning programs or training their staff, leveraging the owner’s certifications and 35+ years of industry knowledge
ecoadvantageinc.com
ecoadvantageinc.com
.
Page Content: On each service page, include 2-3 paragraphs of detailed information about that service, why it’s important, and how Eco Advantage excels in it. Incorporate client benefits and any specific approaches or technologies used (for instance, mention modern tools and techniques
ecoadvantageinc.com
). Include a few region keywords per page (e.g., “serving clients in Southwest Michigan” on the Michigan-focused pages).
Calls to Action on Pages: Each service page should end with a clear call-to-action – e.g. “Contact us today for professional [Service Name] in MI & IN” – and a button or link to the Contact form or phone number. This encourages conversions from each page.
Navigation Menu: Update the site menu to list these service pages (possibly under a “Services” dropdown). Ensure it’s easy for visitors to find each service. For example, a hover menu for “Services” listing Window Cleaning, Power Washing, Healthcare Cleaning, Carpet & Floor Care, Consulting, etc. so users (and search engines) see all offerings at a glance.
Content Enhancements & Professional Tone
Highlight Experience & Credentials: Emphasize the company’s long history and expertise to build trust. For example, mention “Over 50 years of family experience in the Michiana cleaning industry” (since 1968) and “over 14 years in business as Eco Advantage Inc”
ecoadvantageinc.com
ecoadvantageinc.com
. Include the owner’s qualifications, like Certified Master Textile Cleaner with 11 certifications
ecoadvantageinc.com
, in the About Us or home page – this is a strong selling point.
Consistent Professional Tone: Review all text for a consistent, professional voice. Use either first person plural (“We”) or third person consistently when referring to the company (the old site mixed “I” and “We”). A company perspective (using “We”) is likely more appropriate for a professional tone. Ensure grammar and spelling are perfect and the tone is confident and courteous.
Expand on “Why Choose Us”: If not already present, add a “Why Choose Us” section or page. You can repurpose and update the old content which mentions knowledgeable technicians, superior quality, modern tools
ecoadvantageinc.com
, fair pricing, and the passion for the job
ecoadvantageinc.com
ecoadvantageinc.com
. Use bullet points or icons for each advantage (e.g. “✅ 35+ Years of Expertise,” “✅ Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products
ecoadvantageinc.com
,” “✅ Fully Licensed & Insured,” “✅ Satisfaction Guaranteed”). This helps convince visitors and can include additional keywords (like “expert cleaning in Michiana”).
Geo-Targeted Testimonials: If possible, include a few testimonials or case studies from clients in Michigan or Indiana. Even if fictional for now, having a testimonial like “Eco Advantage did an amazing job on our office windows in South Bend!” adds credibility and local relevance. Place these on the home page or a dedicated testimonials section.
Update Contact Information Everywhere: Ensure the correct phone numbers for Michigan and Indiana are prominently displayed on every page (e.g., top header and footer) as clickable links
ecoadvantageinc.com
. If the business has a physical address, list it in the footer or contact page for local SEO. Provide an email contact if available as well.
Design & User Experience Enhancements
Modern Clean Design: Revamp the site’s look to be clean, uncluttered, and modern. Use the company’s branding and logo colors throughout for consistency (for example, if the logo is green and blue, integrate those as accent colors for headings, buttons, and highlights). Maintain plenty of white space and a readable font to keep it professional and easy to navigate.
Responsive Layout: Ensure the website is fully responsive and looks great on mobile devices and tablets. Test the layout on smaller screens – navigation menu should collapse into a mobile-friendly format (e.g., a hamburger menu), text should be legible without zooming, and buttons easy to tap. A significant portion of local service searches happen on mobile, so this is crucial.
Engaging Hero Section: If not present, add a strong hero section on the homepage. This could be a high-quality image of the team at work (window cleaning or power washing action shot) overlaid with a bold tagline like “Premier Cleaning Services in Southwest Michigan & Northern Indiana”
ecoadvantageinc.com
 and a “Get a Free Quote” button. This immediately tells visitors what you do and where.
Use of Animations: Introduce subtle animations to make the site feel dynamic and modern. For example, as the user scrolls, have sections fade in or slide in (you can use a CSS library like AOS (Animate on Scroll) or simple CSS transitions). Ensure animations are smooth and professional – e.g., icons in the “Why Choose Us” section could have a gentle hover effect or appear with a small fade/zoom. Avoid overly flashy animations; keep them subtle and in line with the professional tone.
Interactive Elements: Add some interactive visual touches: for instance, hover effects on buttons and links, a slight highlight or underline on navigation hover, and perhaps an animation on the hero text (like a typewriter effect or fade-in) to draw attention. These modern touches can make the site feel up-to-date and engaging without detracting from the content.
High-Quality Images: Ensure that all images used are clear and relevant. If available, include images of the team (perhaps the owner or crew in uniform), and before-and-after shots of cleaning jobs. This visual proof can be compelling. Compress images for web to maintain site speed. Each service page should have at least one image related to that service (e.g., someone power washing a building for the Power Washing page).
Conversion Optimization (Driving Sales/Leads)
Prominent Contact & CTA Buttons: Make it as easy as possible for visitors to contact the company. Include a “Contact Us” or “Get a Quote” button in the top navigation bar and in the hero section. Throughout the pages, especially at the end of each service description, have a clear CTA button (e.g., “Request a Free Estimate”) leading to the contact form or triggering a scroll to it. Use a contrasting color for these buttons (consistent with branding) so they stand out.
Contact Form Accessibility: The contact form should be readily accessible – possibly featured on the home page and also available on a dedicated Contact page. Keep the form simple (name, contact info, a dropdown or checkboxes for service interested in, message). The current form uses a spam-prevention question
ecoadvantageinc.com
 – consider keeping a simple captcha or honeypot to reduce spam, but ensure it’s user-friendly. Confirm that form submissions still save to the leads database (the leads.csv) or send email notifications as intended.
Phone Number Callouts: In addition to the header/footer, consider a “Call Now” banner or button especially for mobile visitors (like a fixed footer button “📞 Call for a Free Quote” that dials the number when tapped). Many users will want to simply call, so make it one-click easy.
Trust Badges and Certifications: Display any certification logos or badges (e.g., IICRC logo for carpet cleaning certification, any affiliation badges, or even something like BBB if they have it). For example, noting “IICRC Certified” in text is great, but a badge icon could catch the eye. This builds trust and can slightly improve conversion by reassuring customers of professionalism.
Social Proof: If the business has positive Google Reviews or Facebook page reviews, highlight a snippet or the star rating. Even linking to a Facebook page or displaying a “X stars on Google” badge can add credibility. Additionally, ensure the site’s footer or contact section links to social media profiles (like the Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram already present
ecoadvantageinc.com
) so visitors can verify the company’s activity and reputation there.
Fast Load Times: Optimize the site for quick loading – compress CSS/JS, optimize images – so that users (and Google) get fast performance. Slow sites can drive visitors away, especially on mobile.
Additional Recommendations
Content Refresh: Ensure all information is up-to-date (e.g., years of experience, services offered, contact info). If the company has new services or updated credentials since the old content, include them. For instance, if Kevin Hargis has more than 11 certifications now or new training, update that number. Keeping content current helps both SEO and user trust.
Internal Linking: Add internal links within content for SEO. For example, in the home page intro text when you mention “window washing” or “carpet cleaning,” link those keywords to the respective new service pages. This helps users navigate and helps search engines understand site structure.
Blog/Resources (Optional): If time/resources permit, consider adding a Blog or Resources section for SEO. Posting occasional articles like “Tips for Maintaining Windows in Winter in Michigan” or “Benefits of Eco-Friendly Carpet Cleaning” can attract regional readers and improve search rankings. This can be a future enhancement if not now – the priority is the main site content and pages.
Analytics & Tracking: Include Google Analytics or similar tracking code to gather data on site visitors and see which pages perform well or need improvement. This will help in measuring the increased traffic and refining SEO over time.
Competitor Comparison: Without specific competitors listed, a general rule is to ensure this site at least matches or exceeds typical competitor sites in content depth and design. After implementing the above changes, the site should offer more comprehensive information (multiple service pages, detailed content, trust signals) and a more modern look than most local cleaning service websites – thereby helping Eco Advantage Inc. stand out and “crush” the competition in both search ranking and client impression.
Once these changes are implemented, review the entire website end-to-end as a user. Make sure the messaging is compelling, pages link correctly, and there are no placeholder texts or broken elements left from the old version. The result should be a polished, optimized website that clearly communicates Eco Advantage’s services and strengths to potential customers in Michigan and Indiana, and effectively converts visitors into leads.
