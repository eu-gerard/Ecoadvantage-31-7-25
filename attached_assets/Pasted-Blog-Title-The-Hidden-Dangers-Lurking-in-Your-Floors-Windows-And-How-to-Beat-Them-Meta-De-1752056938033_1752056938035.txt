Introduction
When’s the last time your windows sparkled? Or your carpets felt brand new?
If you’re like most Michigan homeowners or property managers, your to-do list is long — and cleaning often falls to the bottom. But what if skipping those tasks was costing you more than you thought?

At Eco Advantage Inc., we help busy property owners like you eliminate the hidden dangers that build up in floors, grout, windows, and walls — with professional-grade, affordable cleaning that’s trusted across Michigan.

The Bacteria You Can’t See (But Shouldn’t Ignore)
Carpets, tiles, and even windows are breeding grounds for allergens, bacteria, and mold spores. According to the EPA, indoor air quality is often 2–5 times worse than outdoors, and poor cleaning routines are a leading cause.

That’s where we come in.

✅ IICRC-Certified Carpet Cleaning
✅ Tile & Grout Cleaning and Restoration
✅ Commercial Floor Care (Strip, Wax, Buff)

Our experts follow the highest standards to ensure your home or commercial building isn’t just clean — it’s hygienically safe.
